### Pet Care

I really like animals, not just pets. I enjoy watching ants move their homes and caterpillars crawling on leaves in the spring. Even though Iâ€™m very allergic to cat and dog fur, my family back home has two cats and a dog.

### travel

I love traveling and experiencing the cultures of different countries. Although I haven't visited many places yet :), I hope to explore more of the world in the future.

### Games
I'm a big fan of MMO games, and my favorite is JX3. I once achieved a top-five ranking in my server's PVE mode as a healer class. I also enjoy card games, such as Hearthstone (but only PVE). Recently, I've been playing a card game called Inscryption. In addition, I'm a fan of simulation games like Stardew Valley.
