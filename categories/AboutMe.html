        Hi, I'm Yuqian Zheng, a PhD student at Sungkyunkwan University in the 
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dxlab/intro?authuser=0" target="_blank">Data eXperience Lab</a>. 
        My previous work and research have focused on natural language processing and computer vision projects in AI for healthcare. 
        To dive deeper into my research interests, I left my corporate job and came to Korea to further my studies. During my PhD, 
        I aim to specialize in image generation within the field of computer vision.
